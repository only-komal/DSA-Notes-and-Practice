/*
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
*/

//solution:-
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> s(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int longest = 0;

        for (int x : s) {
            // start only if x is the beginning
            if (s.find(x - 1) == s.end()) {
                int curr = x;
                int streak = 1;

                while (s.find(curr + 1) != s.end()) {
                    curr++;
                    streak++;
                }

                longest = max(longest, streak);
            }
        }
        return longest;
        
    }
};

We could use the inbuilt function from STL it'll give us the next permutation of the string and then we can return it
int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
next_Permutation(nums.begin(), nums.end());
return nums;
}
